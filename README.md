MinecraftWebTrading

Hello and welcome to my plugin MWT.

The goal of this plugin is to be able to trade ingame inventory with other players.
So to get plugin working you'll need a webserver on the same hardware PC. You'll need to have Apache2 and PHP installed.
You put the plugin in the Bukkit server and this is it.

If you want to test the plugin, you can visit my server at: mglolenstine.us.to

Big thanks to MGlolenstine and all web Java tutorials.
